This study incorporates an artificial intelligence application used in conjunction with augmented reality (AR). AR stands out as a technology where virtual objects interact with the real world. The research focuses on creating a dataset by using AR to automatically capture photographs of a computer-aided design (CAD) model at a specific angle and on a specific surface (such as a book cover) by rotating and moving it.

The captured photographs have been utilized to construct a dataset. This dataset includes labeled examples containing the specific surface positions of objects in the real world. Subsequently, a model has been trained on this dataset using deep learning methods.

The developed artificial intelligence program has the ability to predict the position of a real object when placed on a specific surface. This prediction is made among specific positions (such as top right, bottom left, bottom right, top left). By learning patterns in the training dataset, the artificial intelligence model can accurately predict the object's position in the real world.

This study highlights the successful integration of AR technology and deep learning methods, demonstrating the capability to predict the positions of objects on specific surfaces. This method has practical applications in industrial design, education, and various other fields.
